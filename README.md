# A beauty app utilizing machine learning, Python, Javascript, and HTML 


### Topic and Rationale:

The team plans to use an existing dataset that has varying shades of foundation offered by a variety of beauty brands and their corresponding hex value. We plan to deploy an app that will allow the user to upload images and with ML the app will be able to detect the skin tone and provide an appropriate match to a specific foundation: 

### Data: 

CSV File which contains the data for varying foundation brands: 


### Source of the Data:

The data was collected from a list of best selling beauty brands in the US, Nigeria, India, and Japan. Foundations were chosen that had the largest number of shades available and the hex color values were recorded for each of the colored swatches shown for the product.
